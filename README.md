# WinUI3Preview3_Problems_FileOpenPicker

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating the FileOpenPicker in both UWP and WinUI3 Preview3.

In the UWP sample solution, the FileOpenPicker works as expected for both single file selection (PickSingleFileAsync) and the multiple files selection (PickMultipleFilesAsync).

However, the WinUI3 Preview 3 Desktop sample solution breaks on the multiple files selection and open (PickMultipleFilesAsync).
